This program automatically changes your steam avatar. http://i.imgur.com/4qUCv8A.gifv

It works by sending post requests to the uploading page ( http://steamcommunity.com/actions/FileUploader?type=player_avatar_image&sId=yoursteamid64&bgColor=262627 )

It requires your steamid64, sessionid, and steam cookie. To get those you can go to the uploading page, and view the uploading pages source. The steam cookie can be acquired through your browser. Its exact name is "SteamLogin".
